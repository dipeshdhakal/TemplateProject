# iOS Template project

## What is this?

A templete iOS project with the basic building blocks / boilerplate foundation thats needed for most of the conventional iOS apps. This project does not have any third party dependency.

## Architecture

I have decided to go with Clean code architecture. You can see distinct layers presentation, domain, network and data layer with dependency injection using protocol abstractions. The idea is to make it 100% unit testable. However, please note there are very few unit tests written but the code is unit testable.


## Features
1. Async await with async stream
2. Universal link and dynamic deeplinking
3. SwiftData
4. Biometric integration
5. Dark / light mode support

7. Bonus - Passkey
